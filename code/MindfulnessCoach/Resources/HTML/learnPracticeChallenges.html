	<h4>Practice Challenges with PTSD</h4>
	<p>
		Mindfully paying attention in the moment can feel complicated with PTSD. Some Veterans and 
		Service Members can feel like they’re barely holding on in the midst of an internal storm, 
		and the idea of “letting go” or “relaxing” can be terrifying. Even experienced mindfulness 
		meditators may need to pace their mindfulness practice when intense or traumatic memories and 
		feelings come up. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		It’s important to find a way to practice mindfulness that works for you. Mindfulness instructions 
		suggest that you stay relaxed, notice your thoughts, and let them pass, without getting ‘attached’ 
		to discomfort. While this is ideal, it is not helpful to try to tolerate intense, overwhelming pain. 
		Instead, practice sitting with discomfort that is tolerable but challenging, in order to build your 
		skill and expand your capacity, but don’t force yourself to stay with pain that feels beyond your 
		limits. Many people also report that it’s better to start slowly with a meditation practice, beginning 
		with mindfulness of the five senses or walking mindfulness, rather than beginning with mindfulness of 
		especially difficult thoughts and feelings.

	<p>
		Go slowly and listen to yourself: start with a practice of 1 minute, or 5 minutes— whatever is 
		comfortable—then gradually add more time.
