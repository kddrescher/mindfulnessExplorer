		Mindfulness activities are opportunities to experience things just as they are, 
		and to practice basic awareness of your experience without evaluating, judging, 
		or needing to fix, prolong, or stop that experience.
		<br><br>
		Use these exercises to help you practice mindfulness in a variety of ways, some of 
		which may be more or less challenging for you. Start with the easier activities 
		and gradually move to the harder ones.
