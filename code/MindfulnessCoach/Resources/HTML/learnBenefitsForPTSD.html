	<h4>Benefits of Mindfulness for PTSD</h4>
	<p>
		If you have PTSD, you may find yourself overwhelmed at times by intense feelings and 
		thoughts related to your trauma. This may lead you to try to avoid those experiences, 
		or act impulsively with reckless behavior, using alcohol or drugs, or other reactions 
		that are problematic in the short-term or long-term. Although mindfulness can’t necessarily 
		make your painful thoughts and feelings go away, over time it can shift how you experience 
		them, how disruptive they feel, and the degree to which they “get to” you.

	<p>
		For example, say you encounter a trauma trigger, such as hearing a sudden, loud sound that 
		reminds you of a gunshot. You might feel your chest tighten and your heart begin to pound; 
		you might feel sudden fear and dread. Mindfulness allows you to take a step back and notice 
		that. You observe it rather than getting caught up it. Your stress level may even out or 
		sometimes even decrease instead of feeding on itself and getting worse.
