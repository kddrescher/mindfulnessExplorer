<div class="wrapper bordered">
	<p>Select pictures from your photo albums that will allow you to focus your entire attention on the colors, the textures, and the features of the image.</p>
	
	<p>For this exercise, find a comfortable and quiet place to sit, where you are unlikely to be disturbed. You will be putting all of your attention onto a picture from your library. Try not to get wrapped up in the meaning of the person, place, or thing in the image.</p>
