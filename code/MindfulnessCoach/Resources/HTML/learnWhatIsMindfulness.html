		Mindfulness means paying attention, on purpose, to whatever is going on 
		in the present moment without passing judgment on it. This practice involves 
		noticing something and holding it in your attention lightly, with gentle 
		acceptance, like a butterfly resting on your hand, until it moves away on its own. 
		In mindfulness, you attend to a feeling, thought, or sensation without clinging to 
		it, resisting it, or trying to change it.
