		The mindfulness log can help you track when and how often you are 
		practicing mindfulness tools. It is also a place to keep notes on 
		what you notice when you practice. Using the log may help you remember 
		to practice, and it will show you if you are keeping up on your 
		commitment to mindfulness in your daily life.
		<br><br>
		Each time you use mindfulness activities on this app you can choose to 
		log them. Feel free to enter the log and add comments after you complete 
		the exercise. Even if you do mindfulness activities that are not on the app, 
		you can record them here by typing in all of the information.
