  <h4>Self-Guided Exercise</h4>

  <p>Please read the following script through until you feel familiar with it, then follow the instructions on your own.</p>
	<img src="placeholderSlug.png" alt="Person meditating." class="floatRight" width="134" height="140" data-lowres="practiceMindfulBreathing.png" data-retina="practiceMindfulBreathing@2x.png"><p>Sit comfortably in a chair with your feet on the floor and your body upright.</p>
    <p>Notice your body's contact with the environment. Feel yourself sitting in your chair, your feet on the ground, the bend of your joints, the clothes on your skin. Then let your gaze soften, and take a moment to pay attention to all of the sounds that you hear.</p>
    <p>Release your attention from the sounds around you and place your attention on the tip of your nose, and begin to notice your breath moving in and out of your nostrils. Notice the change in air temperature between the in breath and out breath. Gently follow your breathing, also noticing the rise and fall of your chest and belly. Relax into your breathing, and allow it to be natural and unforced.</p>
    <p>If you become distracted by your thoughts, just notice this and return your attention to your breathing. If you get distracted 100 times, that's ok &mdash; just keep coming back to your breath. Now take the next few minutes to attend completely to your breathing.</p>
    <p>When you are ready, bring your attention away from your breath and notice the sounds around you for a few moments. Then, focus on the sensations in your body again. When you are ready, focus your eyes on the room around you, stretch if you like, and go on with your day.</p>
