	<h4>Managing PTSD Symptoms During Mindfulness Practice</h4>
	<p>If you find you are triggered or overwhelmed with PTSD symptoms during mindfulness practice:</p>

	<ul>
<li>Recognize that there is no need to “muscle through.” Practice at a level that may feel challenging, but that isn’t overwhelming. </li>
		<li>Shift your attention away from internal states like feelings, thoughts or sensations.</li>
		<li>Focus on sounds, sights, or people around you.</li>
		<li>Take some deep breaths and focus on the sensation of your feet on the floor to “ground” yourself.</li>
	</ul>
