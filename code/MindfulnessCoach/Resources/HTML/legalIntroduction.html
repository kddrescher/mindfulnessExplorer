		Welcome to Mindfulness Coach. Mindfulness is paying attention on purpose to what is 
		going on in the current moment. Many Veterans and Service Members can benefit from 
		mindfulness practice. Healthy people may practice mindfulness to increase their resilience 
		and build positive skills for managing their lives. Individuals who are struggling with 
		problems following a deployment can use consistent mindfulness practice to decrease stress, 
		depression, physical pain, and other problems.  This app was developed to help Veterans and 
		Service Members learn how to practice mindfulness. It offers exercises, information, and a 
		tracking log so that you can optimize your practice.

		<strong>Please note:</strong> This app is not intended to replace therapy. If you are in 
		treatment, let your healthcare provider know that you will be using the app for independent 
		mindfulness practice.
