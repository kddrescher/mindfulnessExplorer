		Mindfulness means paying attention, on purpose, to whatever is going on 
		in the present moment without passing judgment on it. This practice involves 
		noticing something and holding it in your attention lightly, with gentle 
		acceptance, like a butterfly resting on your hand, until it moves away on its own. 
		In mindfulness, you attend to a feeling, thought, or sensation without clinging to 
		it, resisting it, or trying to change it.
	</p>

<h4>Benefits of Mindfulness Meditation for Veterans and Service Members:</h4>
	<p>
		Unfortunately, depression and anxiety are more common among Veterans and Service Members 
		than among civilians. Mindfulness practice can have unique advantages for these groups since 
		it has been shown to be effective for: 
	</p>
	
	<ul>
<li>Stress reduction</li>
		<li>Decreasing the struggle with anxiety and depression</li>
		<li>Protecting against relapse to depression (getting depression again and again)</li>
	</ul>
<h4>Benefits of Mindfulness for PTSD</h4>
	<p>
		If you have PTSD, you may find yourself overwhelmed at times by intense feelings and 
		thoughts related to your trauma. This may lead you to try to avoid those experiences, 
		or act impulsively with reckless behavior, using alcohol or drugs, or other reactions 
		that are problematic in the short-term or long-term. Although mindfulness can’t necessarily 
		make your painful thoughts and feelings go away, over time it can shift how you experience 
		them, how disruptive they feel, and the degree to which they “get to” you. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		For example, say you encounter a trauma trigger, such as hearing a sudden, loud sound that 
		reminds you of a gunshot. You might feel your chest tighten and your heart begin to pound; 
		you might feel sudden fear and dread. Mindfulness allows you to take a step back and notice 
		that. You observe it rather than getting caught up it. Your stress level may even out or 
		sometimes even decrease instead of feeding on itself and getting worse. 
	</p>
	
	<h4>Practice Challenges with PTSD</h4>
	<p>
		Mindfully paying attention in the moment can feel complicated with PTSD. Some Veterans and 
		Service Members can feel like they’re barely holding on in the midst of an internal storm, 
		and the idea of “letting go” or “relaxing” can be terrifying. Even experienced mindfulness 
		meditators may need to pace their mindfulness practice when intense or traumatic memories and 
		feelings come up. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		It’s important to find a way to practice mindfulness that works for you. Mindfulness instructions 
		suggest that you stay relaxed, notice your thoughts, and let them pass, without getting ‘attached’ 
		to discomfort. While this is ideal, it is not helpful to try to tolerate intense, overwhelming pain. 
		Instead, practice sitting with discomfort that is tolerable but challenging, in order to build your 
		skill and expand your capacity, but don’t force yourself to stay with pain that feels beyond your 
		limits. Many people also report that it’s better to start slowly with a meditation practice, beginning 
		with mindfulness of the five senses or walking mindfulness, rather than beginning with mindfulness of 
		especially difficult thoughts and feelings. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Go slowly and listen to yourself: start with a practice of 1 minute, or 5 minutes— whatever is 
		comfortable—then gradually add more time. 
	</p>
	
	<h4>Managing PTSD Symptoms During Mindfulness Practice</h4>
	<p>If you find you are triggered or overwhelmed with PTSD symptoms during mindfulness practice:</p>

	<ul>
<li>Recognize that there is no need to “muscle through.” Practice at a level that may feel challenging, but that isn’t overwhelming. </li>
		<li>Shift your attention away from internal states like feelings, thoughts or sensations.</li>
		<li>Focus on sounds, sights, or people around you.</li>
		<li>Take some deep breaths and focus on the sensation of your feet on the floor to “ground” yourself.</li>
	</ul>
